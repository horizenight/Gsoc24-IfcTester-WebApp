[TODO : Update Privious Jourula]

## Journal Entry - [27 Aug 2024]

### Plan
- Complete the 'has value' complex restriction in the complex restrictions dropdown.

### Difficulties
1. The dropdown to control should be dynamic and render the appropriate template. The difficulty arises from detecting the existing `minExclusive`, `minInclusive`, etc., and then correctly showing the corresponding options in the dropdown.
2. When an option is changed, it should create the appropriate `idsElement` that will be used to verify the `idsDocument`.

### Accomplishment
- Loading is completed.
- Currently working on the Dropdown option to create the appropriate `idsElement`.
